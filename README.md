## Problem

Sometimes it takes months, even years for people feel at home in a new place. Even when you live in a place after 3-4 years, there might still be places around you that you might not have explored. We plan to expedite this process by helping users stumble on their new favorite local activity.

## Target User Group

Time Capsule is targeted toward individuals who feel like they are outsiders in their environment, including but not limited to young professionals, families, and even people who were just too busy to explore their local environment, which is a common occurrence amongst Berkeley students.

## Solution

We provide a tool to help newcomers to an area become aware of local activities, make their own memories, and ultimately leave their own unique mark so that they ultimately feel "at home". Our app would ideally support the creation of new time capsules (referred to as "box") at the user's current location, the capturing and uploading of media to these boxes, recalling saved boxes and navigating to their location, and the viewing of local boxes (if they are set as "public") that other users have uploaded.
